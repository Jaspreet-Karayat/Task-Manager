# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JaspreetKarayat

Welcome to my Web Development Portfolio! This repository showcases my skills and projects as I learn to build websites and web applications.

## ðŸŒŸ Skills

### 1. **React.js**
- I am learning React.js to build dynamic, single-page applications. React helps me manage the content and UI efficiently, making development faster and more modular.

### 2. **Tailwind CSS**
- I use Tailwind CSS to create custom, responsive designs with utility-first classes, providing flexibility and consistency in styling my applications.

### 3. **Bootstrap**
- I use Bootstrap to quickly build responsive websites with pre-designed components like buttons, navigation bars, and forms, ensuring a polished UI with minimal effort.

### 4. **Redux Toolkit**
- I am learning Redux Toolkit to simplify state management in my React applications, enabling me to handle complex state interactions more predictably and efficiently.

### 5. **Node.js**
- I use Node.js to build server-side applications, creating scalable and efficient backend services for my web projects.

### 6. **Express.js**
- I use Express.js, a minimal and flexible Node.js framework, to design and implement RESTful APIs and server-side logic.

### 7. **MongoDB**
- I use MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and manage data in a flexible, document-oriented format, making it ideal for modern web applications.
